# Statistics Review

# Overview

__Goal:__ Learn about a population.

- In particular, learn about an unknown population _parameter_.

__Challenge:__ Usually cannot access information about the entire population.

__Solution:__ Sample from the population and estimate the parameter.

- Draw `\(n\)` observations from the population, then use an estimator.

---
# Sampling

There are myriad ways to produce a sample,&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; but we will restrict our attention to __simple random sampling__, where

1. Each observation is a random variable.

2. The `\(n\)` random variables are independent.

3. Life becomes much simpler for the econometrician.

.footnote[
&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; Only a subset of these can help produce reliable statistics.
]

---
# Estimators

An __estimator__ is a rule (or formula) for estimating an unknown population parameter given a sample of data.

--

- Each observation in the sample is a random variable.

--

- An estimator is a combination of random variables `\(\implies\)` it is a random variable.

__Example:__ Sample mean

$$
\bar{X} = \dfrac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i
$$

- `\(\bar{X}\)` is an estimator for the population mean `\(\mu\)`.

- Given a sample, `\(\bar{X}\)` yields an __estimate__ `\(\bar{x}\)` or `\(\hat{\mu}\)`, a specific number.

# Population *vs.* Sample

**Question:** Why do we care about *population vs. sample*?

**Answer:** Uncertainty matters.

- `\(\hat{\mu}\)` is a random variable that depends on the sample.

- In practice, we don't know whether our sample is similar to the population or not. 

- Individual samples may have means that differ greatly from the population.

- We will have to keep track of this uncertainty.

# Properties of Estimators

Imagine that we want to estimate an unknown parameter `\(\mu\)`, and we know the distributions of three competing estimators. __Which one should we use?__ 

&lt;img src="03-Statistics_Review_files/figure-html/competing pdfs-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Properties of Estimators

**Question:** What properties make an estimator reliable?

--

**Answer 1: Unbiasedness.**

On average (after *many* samples), does the estimator tend toward the correct value?

**More formally:** Does the mean of estimator's distribution equal the parameter it estimates?

$$ \mathop{\text{Bias}_\mu} \left( \hat{\mu} \right) = \mathop{\mathbb{E}}\left[ \hat{\mu} \right] - \mu $$

]

---
# Properties of Estimators

**Question:** What properties make an estimator reliable?

**Answer 2: Low Variance (a.k.a. Efficiency).**

The central tendencies (means) of competing distributions are not the only things that matter. We also care about the **variance** of an estimator.

$$ \mathop{\text{Var}} \left( \hat{\mu} \right) = \mathop{\mathbb{E}}\left[ \left( \hat{\mu} - \mathop{\mathbb{E}}\left[ \hat{\mu} \right] \right)^2 \right] $$

Lower variance estimators produce estimates closer to the mean in each sample.

&lt;img src="03-Statistics_Review_files/figure-html/variance pdf-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# The Bias-Variance Tradeoff

Should we be willing to take a bit of bias to reduce the variance?

In econometrics, we generally prefer unbiased estimators. Some other disciplines think more about this tradeoff.

&lt;img src="03-Statistics_Review_files/figure-html/variance bias-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Unbiased Estimators

In addition to the sample mean, there are several other unbiased estimators we will use often.

- __Sample variance__ to estimate variance `\(\sigma^2\)`.

- __Sample covariance__ to estimate covariance `\(\sigma_{XY}\)`.

- __Sample correlation__ to estimate the population correlation coefficient `\(\rho_{XY}\)`.

---
# Unbiased Estimators

The sample variance `\(S_X^2\)` is an unbiased estimator of the population variance `\(\sigma^2\)`:

`$$S_{X}^2 = \dfrac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar{X})^2.$$`

---
# Unbiased Estimators

The sample covariance `\(S_{XY}\)` is an unbiased estimator of the population covariance `\(\sigma_{XY}\)`:


`$$S_{XY} = \dfrac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y}).$$`

---
# Unbiased Estimators

The sample correlation `\(r_{XY}\)` is an unbiased estimator of the population correlation coefficient `\(\rho_{XY}\)`:

`$$r_{XY} = \dfrac{S_{XY}}{\sqrt{S_X^2} \sqrt{S_Y^2}}.$$`

---
# Hypothesis Testing

Given What do we make of an estimate of the population mean?

- Is it meaningfully different than existing evidence on the population mean?
- Is is _statistically distinguishable_ from previously hypothesized values of the population mean?
- Is the estimate extreme enough to update our prior beliefs about the population mean?

We can conduct statistical tests to address these questions.

---
# Hypothesis Testing

__Null hypothesis (H.sub[0]):__ `\(\mu = \mu_0\)`

__Alternative hypothesis (H.sub[1]):__ `\(\mu \neq \mu_0\)`

--

There are four possible outcomes of our test:

1. We __fail to reject__ the null hypothesis and the null is true.

2. We __reject__ the null hypothesis and the null is false.

3. We __reject__ the null hypothesis, but the null is actually true (**Type I error**).

4. We __fail to reject__ the null hypothesis, but the null is actually false (**Type II error**).

---
# Hypothesis Testing

We __fail to reject__ the null hypothesis and the null is true.

- The defendant was acquitted and he didn't do the crime.

--

We __reject__ the null hypothesis and the null is false.

- The defendant was convicted and he did the crime.

---
# Hypothesis Testing

We __reject__ the null hypothesis, but the null is actually true. 

- The defendant was convicted, but he didn't do the crime!
- **Type I error** (a.k.a. _false positive_)

--

We __fail to reject__ the null hypothesis, but the null is actually false.

- The defendant was acquitted, but he did the crime!
- **Type II error** (a.k.a. _false negative_)

---
# Hypothesis Testing

`\(\hat{\mu}\)` is random: it could be anything, even if `\(\mu = \mu_0\)` is true.

- But if `\(\mu = 0\)` is true, then `\(\hat{\mu}\)` is unlikely to take values far from zero.

- As the variance of `\(\hat{\mu}\)` shrinks, we are even less likely to observe "extreme" values of `\(\hat{\mu}\)` (assuming `\(\mu = \mu_0\)`).

--

Our test should take extreme values of `\(\hat{\mu}\)` as evidence against the null hypothesis, but it should also weight them by what we know about the variance of `\(\hat{\mu}\)`.

- For now, we'll assume that the variable of interest `\(X\)` is normally distributed with mean `\(\mu\)` and standard deviation `\(\sigma^2\)`.

---
# Hypothesis Testing

Reject H.sub[0] if `\(\hat{\mu}\)` lies in the .hi[rejection region].

&lt;img src="03-Statistics_Review_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- The area of the rejection region is defined by the **significance level** of the test.
- In a 5% test, the area is 0.05. 
- Significance level .mono[=] tolerance for Type I error.

---
# Hypothesis Testing

Reject H.sub[0] if `\(\left| z \right| =\left| \dfrac{\hat{\mu} - \mu_0}{\mathop{\text{sd}}(\hat{\mu})} \right| &gt; 1.96\)`.

&lt;img src="03-Statistics_Review_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

What happens to `\(z\)` as `\(\left| \hat{\mu} - \mu_0 \right|\)` increases? 

What happens to `\(z\)` as `\(\mathop{\text{sd}}(\hat{\mu})\)` increases?

---
# Hypothesis Testing

The formula for the `\(z\)` statistic assumes that we know `\(\mathop{\text{sd}}(\hat{\mu})\)`.

- In practice, we don't know `\(\mathop{\text{sd}}(\hat{\mu})\)`, so we have to estimate it.

--

If the variance of `\(X\)` is `\(\sigma^2\)`, then 

`$$\sigma^2_{\hat{\mu}} = \dfrac{\sigma^2}{n}.$$`

- We can estimate `\(\sigma^2\)` with the sample variance `\(S_{X}^2\)`.

--

The sample variance of the sample mean is
 
`$$S_{\hat{\mu}}^2 = \dfrac{1}{n(n-1)} \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar{X})^2.$$`

---
# Hypothesis Testing

The .hi[standard error] of `\(\hat{\mu}\)` is the square root of `\(S_{\hat{\mu}}^2\)`:

`$$\mathop{\text{SE}}(\hat{\mu}) = \sqrt{ \dfrac{1}{n(n-1)} \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar{X})^2}.$$`

- Standard error = sample standard deviation of an estimator.

--

When we use `\(\mathop{\text{SE}}(\hat{\mu})\)` in place of `\(\mathop{\text{sd}}(\hat{\mu})\)`, the `\(z\)` statistic becomes a `\(t\)` statistic:

`$$t = \dfrac{\hat{\mu} - \mu_0}{\mathop{\text{SE}}(\hat{\mu})}.$$`

- Unlike the standard deviation of `\(\hat{\mu}\)`, `\(\mathop{\text{SE}}(\hat{\mu})\)` varies from sample to sample.
- **Consequence:** `\(t\)` statistics do not necessarily have a normal distribution.

---
# Hypothesis Testing

## .hi-green[Normal distribution] vs. .hi-purple[t distribution]

- A normal distribution has the same shape for any sample size.
- The shape of the t distribution depends the **degrees of freedom**.

&lt;img src="03-Statistics_Review_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- Degrees of freedom .mono[=] 500.

---
# Hypothesis Testing

## **t Tests** (two-sided)

To conduct a t test, compare the `\(t\)` statistic to the appropriate .hi[critical value] of the t distribution.

- To find the critical value in a t table, we need the degrees of freedom and the significance level `\(\alpha\)`.

Reject H.sub[0] at the `\(\alpha \cdot 100\)`-percent level if 

`$$\left| t \right| = \left| \dfrac{\hat{\mu} - \mu_0}{\mathop{\text{SE}}(\hat{\mu})} \right| &gt; t_\text{crit}.$$`

# Hypothesis Testing

## On Your Own

As the term progresses, we will encounter additional flavors of hypothesis testing and other related concepts.

You may find it helpful to review the following topics from Math 243:

- Confidence intervals
- One-sided `\(t\)` tests
- `\(p\)` values

# Panel or Longitudinal Data

.hi-purple[Time series for each cross-sectional unit.]

- Example: daily attendance data for a sample of students.

Difficult to collect, but useful for causal identification.

- Can control for _unobserved_ characteristics.

Requires more-advanced methods (EC 421 and many 400-level applied micro classes).

# Messy Data

**Analysis-ready datasets are rare.** Most data are "messy."

The focus of this class is data analysis, but .hi[data wrangling] is a non-trivial part of a data scientist/analyst's job.

.mono[R] has a suite of packages that facilitate data wrangling. 

- `readr`, `tidyr`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2` .mono[+] others.

- Known collectively as the `tidyverse`.

---
# .mono[tidyverse]

## The [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org): A package of packages

`readr`: Functions to import data.

`tidyr`: Functions to reshape messy data.

`dplyr`: Functions to work with data.

`ggplot2`: Functions to visualize data.

---
# Workflow

## Step 1: Load packages with `pacman`


```r
library(pacman)
p_load(tidyverse)
```

If the `tidyverse` hasn't already been installed, `p_load` will install it. 

Loading the `tidyverse` automatically loads `readr`, `tidyr`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, and a few other packages.

---
# Workflow

## Step 2: Import data with `readr`


```r
workers &lt;- read_csv("03-example_data.csv")
```

CSV files are a common non-proprietary format for storing tabular data.

The `read_csv` function imports CSV (comma-separated values) files.

- Converts the CSV file to a [`tibble`](https://tibble.tidyverse.org), the `tidyverse` version of a `data.frame`.

---
# Workflow

## Step 3: Reshape data with `tidyr`

Variables are stored in rows instead of columns:


```r
workers
```

---
# Workflow

## Step 3: Reshape data with `tidyr`

Make the data tidy by using the `spread` function:


```r
workers &lt;- workers %&gt;% 
  spread(key = variable, value = value)
```

Note the use of the .hi[pipe operator].

- .hi[`%&gt;%`] .mono[=] *"and then."*

- Chains multiple commands together without having to define intermediate objects.

---
# Workflow

## Step 3: Reshape data with `tidyr`

The result:


```r
workers
```

---
# Workflow

## Step 4: Manipulate data with `dplyr`

Generate new variables with `mutate`:


```r
workers &lt;- workers %&gt;% 
  mutate(union = ifelse(union == 1, "Yes", "No"))
```

Before, `union` was a binary variable equal to 1 if the worker is in a union or 0 if otherwise.

Now `union` is a character variable.

---
# Workflow

## Step 4: Manipulate data with `dplyr`

The result:


```r
workers
```

---
# Workflow

## Step 6: Visualize and analyze data with `ggplot2`

**How are education and earnings correlated?**


```r
workers %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = educ, y = earnings)) +
  geom_point()
```

---
# Workflow

## Step 6: Visualize and analyze data with `ggplot2`

**How are education and earnings correlated?**

Can also use the `cor` function from `base` .mono[R]:


```r
cor(workers$educ, workers$earnings)
```

---
# Workflow

## Step 6: Visualize and analyze data with `ggplot2`

**How are education and earnings correlated?**


```r
workers %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = educ, y = earnings, color = union)) +
  geom_point()
```

---
# Workflow

## Step 6: Visualize and analyze data with `ggplot2`

**How are education and earnings correlated?**


```r
workers %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = educ, y = earnings, color = union)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(~union)
```

---
# Workflow

## Step 6: Visualize and analyze data with `ggplot2`

**How are education and earnings correlated?**

Can .hi[subset] the data to get group-specific correlations: 


```r
workers_union &lt;- workers %&gt;% 
* filter(union == "Yes")

cor(workers_union$educ, workers_union$earnings)
```


```r
workers_nounion &lt;- workers %&gt;% 
* filter(union == "No")

cor(workers_nounion$educ, workers_nounion$earnings)
```

# Why Bother?

**Q:** Why not just use .mono[.hi-green[MS Excel]] for data wrangling?

--

**A:** .hi[Reproducibility]

- Easier to retrace your steps with .mono[R].

--

**A:** .hi[Portability]

- Easy to re-purpose .mono[R] code for new projects.

--

**A:** .hi[Scalability]

- .mono[Excel] chokes on big datasets.

--

**A:** .hi[.mono[R] Saves time] (eventually)

- Lower marginal costs in exchange for higher fixed costs.
